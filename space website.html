<h1>UNIVERSE</h1>
<p>The physical universe is defined as all of space and time(collectively referred to as spacetime) and their contents.
Such contents comprise all of energy in its various forms, including electromagnetic radiation and matter, 
and therefore planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and the contents of intergalactic space.</p>
<p>The universe (Latin: universus) is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy.
 While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown,it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe, which is currently estimated to be 
 93 billion light-years in diameter. In various multiverse hypotheses, a universe is one of many causally disconnected constituent parts of a larger multiverse,
 which itself comprises all of space and time and its contents.
The earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the center. 
Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. 
In developing the law of universal gravitation, Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus' work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by Tycho Brahe.</p>
<p>Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way, which is one of at least two trillion galaxies 
in the universe. Many of the stars in our galaxy have planets. At the largest scale, galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the universe
 has neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments and voids in space, creating a vast
 foam-like structure.Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding, since then,and is currently still 
 expanding at an increasing rate.

The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the universe. According to estimation of this theory, space and time emerged together 
13.799±0.021 billion years ago and the energy and matter initially present have become less dense as the universe expanded. After an initial accelerated expansion called 
the inflationary epoch at around 10−32 seconds, and the separation of the four known fundamental forces, the universe gradually cooled and continued to expand, allowing the
 first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form. Dark matter gradually gathered, forming a foam-like structure of filaments and voids under the influence of gravity. 
 Giant clouds of hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most dense, forming the first galaxies, stars, and everything else seen today.
 It is possible to see objects that are now further away than 13.799 billion light-years because space itself has expanded, and it is still expanding today. This means that 
 objects which are now up to 46.5 billion light-years away can still be seen in their distant past, because in the past, when their light was emitted, they were much closer to Earth.</p>
 <p>From studying the movement of galaxies, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more matter than is accounted for by visible objects; stars, galaxies,
 nebulas and interstellar gas. This unseen matter is known as dark matter(dark means that there is a wide range of strong indirect evidence that it exists, but we have not
 yet detected it directly). The ΛCDM model is the most widely accepted model of our universe. It suggests that about 69.2%±1.2% [2015] of the mass and energy in the universe
 is a cosmological constant (or, in extensions to ΛCDM, other forms of dark energy, such as a scalar field) which is responsible for the current expansion of space, and about 
 25.8%±1.1% is dark matter. Ordinary ('baryonic') matter is therefore only 4.84%±0.1% of the physical universe. Stars, planets, and visible gas clouds only form about 6% of
 ordinary matter, or about 0.29% of the entire universe.
There are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the universe and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers
 refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible. Some physicists have suggested various multiverse hypotheses, in which our 
 universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.</p>
 <p>The size of the universe is somewhat difficult to define. According to the general theory of relativity, far regions of space may never interact with ours even in 
 the lifetime of the universe due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions
 of space, even if the universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it.
Distant regions of space are assumed to exist and to be part of reality as much as we are, even though we can never interact with them. The spatial region that we can 
affect and be affected by is the observable universe. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact
 with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler will not be able to interact with all of space.
 Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.
The proper distance—the distance as would be measured at a specific time, including the present—between Earth and the edge of the observable universe is 46 billion light-years 
(14 billion parsecs),making the diameter of the observable universe about 93 billion light-years (28 billion parsecs).The distance the light from the edge of the 
observable universe has travelled is very close to the age of the universe times the speed of light, 13.8 billion light-years (4.2×109 pc), but this does not represent
 the distance at any given time because the edge of the observable universe and the Earth have since moved further apart.For comparison, the diameter of a typical galaxy is 
 30,000 light-years (9,198 parsecs), and the typical distance between two neighboring galaxies is 3 million light-years (919.8 kiloparsecs).As an example, the Milky Way
 is roughly 100,000–180,000 light-years in diameter,and the nearest sister galaxy to the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, is located roughly 2.5 million light-years away.
Because we cannot observe space beyond the edge of the observable universe, it is unknown whether the size of the universe in its totality is finite or infinite.
Estimates suggest that the whole universe, if finite, must be more than 250 times larger than the observable universe.Some disputed estimates for the total size of the 
universe, if finite, reach as high as {\displaystyle 10^{10^{10^{122}}}}10^{10^{10^{122}}} megaparsecs, as implied by a suggested resolution of the No-Boundary Proposal.</p>
 <p>Astronomers calculate the age of the universe by assuming that the Lambda-CDM model accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform, hot,
 dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model.[citation needed] This model is well understood
 theoretically and supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP and Planck.[citation needed] Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes
 the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon acoustic 
 oscillation feature.[citation needed] Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages,
 are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present.[citation needed] Assuming that the Lambda-CDM model is correct,
 the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of the age of the universe as of 2015 of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.
Astronomers have discovered stars in the Milky Way galaxy that are almost 13.6 billion years old.
Over time, the universe and its contents have evolved; for example, the relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed and space itself has expanded. 
Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light-years away even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years;
 the very space between them has expanded. This expansion is consistent with the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted; the photons emitted have
 been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey. Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is accelerating.
The more matter there is in the universe, the stronger the mutual gravitational pull of the matter. If the universe were too dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational 
singularity. However, if the universe contained too little matter then the self-gravity would be too weak for astronomical structures, like galaxies or planets, to form.
 Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded monotonically. Perhaps unsurprisingly, our universe has just the right mass-energy density, equivalent to about 5 protons per 
 cubic metre, which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.
There are dynamical forces acting on the particles in the universe which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, it was expected that the expansion rate would be decreasing 
as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the universe; and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the universe called the deceleration 
parameter, which most cosmologists expected to be positive and related to the matter density of the universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different 
groups to be negative, approximately -0.55, which technically implies that the second derivative of the cosmic scale factor {\displaystyle {\ddot {a}}}{\displaystyle {\ddot {a}}} 
has been positive in the last 5-6 billion years. This acceleration does not, however, imply that the Hubble parameter is currently increasing; see deceleration parameter
 for details.</p>
